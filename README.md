I selected the background as Chichen Itza because when I visited Mexico this year and went there its a place that really seems like your in an Indiana Jones movie.

You can select the Ruby, Blue Diamond, Amber (Yes that is the amber from the original Jurassic Park movie) or the Emerald and it will be worth random value between 1 and 12.
